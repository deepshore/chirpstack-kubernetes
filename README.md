# Chirpstack Kubernetes

Chirpstack Kubernetes translates the Docker-Compose from [https://github.com/chirpstack/chirpstack-docker](https://github.com/chirpstack/chirpstack-docker) into a Kubernetes deployment.

Consider it a starting point to derive your own, more sophisticated Kubernetes deployments.
